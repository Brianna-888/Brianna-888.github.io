        <h1>Hi, I'm Brianna Fitzgerald</h1>
        
        <p>I love how our brains need design to function for us both emotionally and intellectually. I enjoy the process of crafting systems that create relief from a pain-point: to ease an experience or process and make it enjoyable, logical and helpful.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Working behind the scenes at a nonprofit for 15 years, bringing my organizational, interpersonal and communication expertise  to the world of UX.

        <h3>User Empathy</h3>
        <p>My approach to user empathy: listening intently, record the interaction, still take notes while interviewing. Identify the problem and relate to your own life. 
</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Qualitative Interviews </h3>
        <p> The most important data we ever have is what the user does, says and, hopefully, they tell us what they think.

          <h4>Border Route Trail: Nonprofit Website ReDesign</h4>
      
          <p>We took a website that was last updated in 2012 and made it responsive and attractive. Most importantly, the maps were updated and made to download for no service BWCA.

          <h4>TrueMart</h4>
          <p>Our idea to create an app to help locate fresh produce came from our interviews. As we said, the key foundation of our ideation came from our user interviews. Listening is everything! </p>
